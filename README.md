# Fakestore Storefront Project

This is a mock storefront created to showcase my unique style and sense of humor, as well as demonstrate a complex React application. The website offers various features such as the ability to add items to a virtual shopping cart, view previous orders made on the site, and navigate through dynamic product pages using React Router. The website was developed with the use of [MockAPI.io](http://mockapi.io/) as the backend.
