      <Accordion.Header>Q. What API did you use for the backend?
</Accordion.Header>
        <Accordion.Body>
          A. All of the backend is hosted on MockAPI.io, which offers both free and paid options for creating custom APIs. I opted for the paid service to manage various projects, including the Dog Park Scheduler and Comment Feed.

        <Accordion.Header>Q. Why are some of these pictures mildly inappropriate, or distasteful?
</Accordion.Header>
        <Accordion.Body>
         A. The images on this site are obtained from Faker.js, a source for generating fake data. While I could have chosen different images, using Faker.js images made the overall style more realistic, even though there was a possibility of inappropriate content. I apologize if any of the images were offensive. My intention was to highlight the design of the site, and I hope that's what you'll focus on as well.

        <Accordion.Header>Q. Why donâ€™t you have a full checkout form?</Accordion.Header>
        <Accordion.Body>
         A. I chose the listed fields intentionally so that you could input fictitious information to test the system's functionality. To ensure that you feel at ease when providing false data we didn't do actual payment inputs.
